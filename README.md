IFAFoundation is a framework containing a collection of enhancements on top of Cocoa Touch foundation frameworks for iOS apps and app extensions. It requires iOS 8 or greater and it is safe to be linked against app extensions.

This framework has been used in a few projects for my clients.

Additional documentation and sample code are coming soon.
